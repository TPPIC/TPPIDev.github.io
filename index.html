<p>Test Pack Please Ignore: Continued (TPPIC) is a modpack making team formed after the TPPI team discontinued their latest and final modpack, TPPI2<p>

<p>TPPIC's first project was TPPI2C, a continuation of TPPI2 from where it was left off. After completion of the TPPI2C modpack, it was decided upon that TPPI2C would be pushed as the 1.0.0 update to TPPI2.</p>

<p>TPPIC's first original modpack, TPPI3C, is currently underway and there is no reasonable ETA that we can give at this time. We are currently assembling mod lists and working out how we plan on putting the pack together.</p>

<p>Just as the TPPI team once said, <em>"We pride ourselves on making sure our packs feel like everything works together. Less time fighting over making mods work together means more time playing and enjoying the game. We have gone to great lengths to improve stability and coherence, which is needed with so many mods in the pack,"</em> and we, the TPPIC team, wholeheartedly agree with this ideaology and <b>WILL</b> continue to use this as a guideline for our future modpack projects.</p>

<p>Test Pack Please Ignore 3 (Continued) is a modpack designed to mash up the new and the old mods, to create a semi-retro-style modpack built with heavy balance and mod interaction as top priorities.</p>

<p>TPPI3C is currently in development and will not be ready for quite a while. We cannot give a reasonable ETA at this time. The modpack, when released, will be released onto the Curse Client.</p>
