<h1>Day 1</h1>

<p>It is the first day. The first day of the diary. It's been a long day. Or a short day. Depending on who you ask. For me, it's been quite short. Very short. I woke up today at about noon. I don't know why, but it's 20:38 now and I am tired. I haven't even been awake 12 hours and I want to sleep. This isn't right. I didn't even stay up late last night. I don't get it. These sentences are getting short. That's meant to make it sound more instense when you read it. Yes, I spelled intense wrong, and I decided to keep writing instead of fixing it. How's your day been? I know you won't be able to reply, but that doesn't matter. Just think about it. You're day. You are day. Yes. I'm Night. You're Day. Don't ask. </p>
