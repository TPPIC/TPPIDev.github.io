{"name":"Test Pack Please Ignore","tagline":"Minecraft Modpack","body":"<div style=\"text-align:center\"><img src =\"http://i.imgur.com/dPuS9nt.png\"/></div>\r\n\r\n# What the heck is this?\r\n\r\nTest Pack Please Ignore (TPPI) is a Modpack for Minecraft.\r\n\r\nIt features a vast amount of mods, while still maintaining a balanced, stable feel.\r\n\r\nWe pride ourselves on making sure the pack feels like everything *works* together. Less time fighting over making mods work together means moer time playing and enjoying the game. We have gone to great lengths to improve stability and coherence, which is needed with so many mods in the pack.\r\n\r\n# Well, how can I start?\r\n\r\nTPPI is currently available on two modpack platforms: [Feed The Beast](http://feed-the-beast.com/) and [Technic](http://technicpack.net/)\r\n\r\n### FTB\r\n\r\nYou can find the pack under the 3rd Party Packs tab in the [FTB Launcher](http://feed-the-beast.com/#download). Simply hit launch and you are ready to go!\r\n\r\n### Technic\r\n\r\nTPPI is the latest main modpack for the Technic platform. This means that it is available on the Technic Launcher without any special URLs or codes needed! Simply download the [Technic Launcher](http://www.technicpack.net/download) and TPPI will be in the list of modpacks on the left. **Note: You will likely need to increase the memory allocation to ATLEAST 2.5GB if using the Technic Launcher**.\r\n\r\nDo note that the pack currently needs java 7 (not 8 and *certainly* not 6) to run at all. Please make sure you have the proper version installed.\r\n\r\nEnjoy.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
